mkdir my_folder
```
This will create a new folder called "my\_folder" in the current working directory. If you want to create the folder in a different location, you can specify the path to that location before the folder name. For example, to create a new folder called "my\_folder" in the "/home/user" directory, you would use the following command:
```bash
mkdir /home/user/my_folder
